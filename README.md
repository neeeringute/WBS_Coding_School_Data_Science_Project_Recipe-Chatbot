The **Recipe Chatbot** is an advanced AI-powered tool developed in **Google Colab** to assist users in the kitchen. Whether you're looking for recipes, ingredient substitutions, or tips on cooking techniques, this chatbot provides instant, accurate, and context-aware answers. It uses cutting-edge technologies like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **HuggingFace models**, **Groq APIs**, and **large language models (LLMs)** to deliver an interactive and seamless experience.

## üìã Key Features
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Based on ingredients, preferences, or user queries.
- **Ingredient Substitutions**: Offers alternatives for unavailable ingredients.
- **Cooking Tips**: Provides guidance on various culinary techniques and methods.
- **Custom Measurement Conversions**: Automatically converts units (e.g., ounces to grams, Fahrenheit to Celsius).
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: User-friendly interface for engaging conversations with the chatbot.
- **Data Organization**: Recipes are categorized for quick and efficient retrieval.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Development Environment
- **Google Colab**: Used for scripting, testing, and prototyping the chatbot functionalities.

### Data Extraction and Preparation
- **PyPDF2 & PyMuPDF**: Extract recipe data and related text from PDF files.
- **JSON Conversion**: Extracted data from the PDF is structured and converted into a **JSON file** for efficient access and management.
- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: Efficient vector-based document storage and retrieval.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building conversational AI with structured workflows.

### Conversational AI
- **HuggingFace Models**: 
  - **Embeddings**: Semantic search using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-l6-v2`.
  - **Language Models**: Generating natural, context-aware responses.
- **Groq APIs**: Handles conversational capabilities and advanced AI integration.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Mistral-7B-Instruct for high-quality text generation.

### Deployment and Interface
- **Streamlit**: Builds an interactive web-based interface for the chatbot.
- **Localtunnel**: Allows public access to the chatbot via secure URLs.

## üìÇ Project Workflow

### 1. Development in Google Colab
Google Colab served as the primary environment for:
- Extracting recipe data from a PDF using PyPDF2 and PyMuPDF.
- Converting the extracted PDF data into a **JSON file** for structured access and reuse.
- Categorizing recipes into structured formats like soups, desserts, and vegetarian options.
- Testing and refining conversational logic using LangChain and FAISS.

### 2. Data Preparation
Recipes are extracted from a PDF recipe book and converted to JSON. This structured data includes:
- **Recipe Categories**: Organized into types like soups, desserts, and vegetarian.
- **Measurement Conversions**: E.g., "1 oz = 28.35 g".
- **Cooking Tips**: Guidelines for freezing, defrosting, and food safety.

The JSON data is further stored in a **FAISS vector database** for fast and accurate retrieval.

### 3. Conversational Retrieval
The chatbot uses **LangChain‚Äôs Conversational Retrieval Chain**, which combines:
- Semantic search with HuggingFace embeddings.
- Context-aware responses powered by Groq APIs and LLMs.

### 4. Chatbot Interaction
The chatbot is deployed via Streamlit, allowing users to:
- Query recipes based on ingredients.
- Get real-time substitutions for missing ingredients.
- Learn cooking techniques or ask for tips.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Installed dependencies: `PyPDF2`, `pymupdf`, `gradio`, `faiss-cpu`, `langchain`

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd recipe-chatbot

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. **Prepare the Data**:

- Place the recipe book PDF in the /content directory of Google Colab.
- Update the file path in the script if necessary.

4. **Extract and Convert Recipes**: 
Run the script in Google Colab to process the PDF and convert it into a structured JSON file:
   ```bash
   python extract_recipes.py
   
5. **Launch the Chatbot: Start the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run rag_app.py
6. Access the Chatbot:

- Use the local URL provided by Streamlit.
- If hosted remotely, the public URL will be generated by Localtunnel.
